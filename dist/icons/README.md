# MuseFlow Icons

This directory contains the Chrome extension icons.

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent design across all sizes
- Ensure icons are clearly visible at small sizes
- Follow Chrome extension icon guidelines
- Consider using a MuseFlow-themed icon (e.g., musical note, creative flow, AI brain)

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions. Replace these with proper MuseFlow-branded icons before publishing.
